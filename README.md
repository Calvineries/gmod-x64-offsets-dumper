# gmod-x64-offsets-dumper
A very bad offsets dumper for gmod x64.
Can be used to update the offsets of my external cheat: https://github.com/Calvineries/Gmod-Nexus-External-ESP

# Instructions:
1) Close your game and then launch it, start a singleplayer game.
2) Open your console and type once: bot and -jump
3) Start this script.
4) Done! You have now the LocalPlayer, EntityList, ViewMatrix, ForceJump and MatFullbright offsets.  
  
If you don't get the pointers:
1) Join a server.
2) Start this script again.
3) Done! You have now the Crosshair, SteamID and PlayerName offsets.  
Be careful, here most of the other addresses are wrong.
