# gmod-x64-offsets-dumper
A very bad offsets dumper for gmod x64.
Can be used to update the offsets of my external cheat: https://github.com/Calvineries/Gmod-Nexus-External-ESP

# Instructions:
1) Close your game and then launch it, start a singleplayer game.
2) Open your console and type once: bot, -attack and -jump
3) Start this script.
4) Done! You have now the LocalPlayer, EntityList, ViewMatrix, ForceAttack, ForceJump offsets.
